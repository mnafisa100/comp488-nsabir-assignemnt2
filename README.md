## 💡 Reflection

Completing this assignment helped me understand the full lifecycle of a simple web project from development to deployment. I learned how to structure a website with HTML and style it in a way that looks clean and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Adding a simple JavaScript feature reinforced how powerful small interactions can be for improving user experience.

I also gained hands-on experience with version control by making multiple commits and pushing my work to GitHub. Setting up Vercel for automatic deployment was particularly insightful, as it demonstrated how changes in my codebase can instantly reflect on a live site with minimal manual steps. Overall, this assignment gave me a practical understanding of a modern development workflow that I can apply to future projects.
